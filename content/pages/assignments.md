Team Project
------------

A key component of this class will be team projects involving Enterprise-level evaluation of value streams from concept development through product delivery and support. These term-long projects will include an assessment of current company process/information flows, resource requirements, technology utilization, and cycle times. The projects will culminate with a report and presentation of summary recommendations on actions required to transition to a "lean" enterprise.
